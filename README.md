# Solar Event Detection with YOLOv11

## Introduction

This project is inspired by the research paper:  
**Baek et al. (2021)** - *‚ÄúSolar Event Detection Using Deep-Learning-Based Object Detection Methods‚Äù*  
The study focuses on detecting and localizing three types of solar phenomena: **prominence**, **sunspot**, and **coronal hole** using object detection models like SSD and Faster R-CNN.

In this implementation, I utilized **YOLOv11**, selected for its advanced architecture designed to improve multi-scale object detection performance. Unlike earlier YOLO versions, YOLOv11 integrates the **C3K2**, **SPPF**, and **C2PSA** modules, enhancing detection across varied object sizes and feature granularities (Rao, 2023).

## Implementation Overview

The project includes two implementations:  
- **Local Environment (PC)**
- **Google Colaboratory**  
Both follow the same dataset split and training structure.

Due to hardware limitations and the experimental nature of this work, the dataset was structured as follows:
- **Training**: 400 images per class
- **Validation**: 27 (prominence), 48 (sunspot), 25 (coronal hole)
- **Testing**: 30 images (combined)

Note: The traditional 4:1 train:test ratio was not strictly followed.
